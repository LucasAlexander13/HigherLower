Do you think you know what movie is the best?
# Higher or Lower
Higher or lower is a game based on The Higher/Lower Game - that asks players to guess which of two Google search terms is most popular - but with movies metascores and a cool ASCII retro art.

## How this game works?
You will see two super-hero movies or shows, and will have to guess which one has the highest metascore.

If you guess correctly, you will score 1 point, and the program will look for another movie to compare.

## How to play this game?
Make sure that Python 3 is installed in your computer.
Use the following git command in your directory:
~~~git
git clone https://github.com/LucasAlexander13/HigherLower.git
~~~

Run the higher_or_lower.py file. You can do this with the command prompt.
~~~system
py YOUR_DIRECTORY/HigherLower/higher_or_lower.py
~~~~
Good luck!
